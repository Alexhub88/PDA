Implementation Contraints Plan

Hardware and software platforms used:

Hardware: Apple MacBook Pro, OS X
Software: -Ruby programming language
          -Sinatra gem from Ruby to run web apps
          -Terminal to run and manage files
          -Atom to create and edit Ruby files
          -Google Chrome to run Sinatra
          -SQL
          -Postgres database
          -Postico to view database records
          -Google Project to create presentation
          -Draw IO to create diagrams

Performance Requirements: ?

Storage and Transactions: data was stored using the Postgres database, with Postico for viewing purposes. Transaction records can be saved, added, edited or deleted by the user with the corresponding operations reflected in SQL.

Usability: the application uses Sinatra to create a user experience which allows all transaction record operations to be easily carried out by the user, using only form buttons and links on the form.

Budget: not a formal requirement for this project, though of course critical in a real life software project.

Time: one week to design, code, style and present the app from start to finish.
