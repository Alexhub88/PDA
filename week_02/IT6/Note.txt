Note: I have used the same example of the Library class for both IT5 and IT6 because this 
class contains both arrays and hashes and shows functions which operate on both.

For the example function chosen, I ran a slightly modified version of the file in this folder, in order to show the output array before and after the function ran. This function is a good example because it uses an array of hashes, and thus satisfies both IT5 and IT6
requirements. The original homework folder was stored as:

/Users/user/codeclan/e20/workfiles/week_02/day_1/homework/codeclan_students/specs/codeclan_students_spec.rb
